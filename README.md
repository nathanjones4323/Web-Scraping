# Web-Scraping
This is not intended for commerical purposes. Purely educational and learning.
Inspiration for the bs4 example comes from https://learningactors.com/how-to-scrape-multiple-pages-of-a-website-using-a-python-web-scraper/. 

I followed along with their example, and applied the learnings to Leafly. Leafly is a popular cannabis review website, almost like Yelp for cannabis strains.
Originally, I was curious to see if there is a relationship between a cannabis strains ratings/type/thc content and the average price that strain is sold for. 
I still need to find a good price dataset to check these claims and do some more exploratory analysis on this scraped Leafly data.

The code is set up to help scrape websites for educational purposes.
